### Welcome to the Note Manager project

The application entry point is the main.py module so to launch the program use 
python3 main.py in your terminal emulator.

Please, check that the ncurses library linked with your current Python version supports 
get_wchar() to avoid the Unicode bugs in the built-in text editor. 

Also, the text editor playing music while you typing your note. Turn sound on =)

The dependencies:

1. Python 3.13.1 and above
2. colorama
3. pygame
4. PyYAML
5. ncurses 5.4 and above
