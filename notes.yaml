    My Python questions
    
    1. How do I check the sizeof(variable)?
    2. Where and how the memory is allocated for the variables?
    3. Is there Heap or Stack concepts in Python?
    4. How can I manage the padding (alignment in the memory) if the variable is lesser than 4 bytes?
    5. What are the best memory consumption reduce practices in Python?
    6. What are the prospects for writing high-performance self-learning models for embedded and IoT using Python?
